My research is driven by my interest in the **ecology of animal migrations**, how they influence ecological processes and thereby ecosystems, and how **global changes** threaten migratory populations and their function. Current projects aim to provide fundamental understanding of migratory routes and schedules, identified drivers and determinants of migration strategies, the individual decisions that organism make before and during migration, and the effects of global and climatic changes. I have worked on the intersection between **wildlife infectious disease dynamics** in waterfowl and movements of birds. I frequently use **remote sensing** datasets to better understand and characterize the underlying environment and changes therein. Finally, I developed and published **tools to analyze animal tracking data** and remotely sensed time series.
