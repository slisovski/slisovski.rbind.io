In my Master project I am investigating different migration strategies of shorebirds on the East-Asian - Australiasian Flyway. For this I use tracking data of seven different species during the migration from wintering grounds to breeding grounds and back. I want to connect the different migration strategies to outbreak data of high pathogenic avian influenza and investigate, how the spatial and temporal dynamics of the spread of this virus are influenced by these different strategies.
