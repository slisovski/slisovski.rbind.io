&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editors’ Choice article&lt;/em&gt;: Lisovski, S., Neumann, R., Albrecht, T., Munclinger, P., Ahola, M.P., Bauer, S., Cepak, J., Fransson, T., Jakobsson, S., Jaakkonen, T., Klvana, P., Kullberg, C., Laaksonen, T., Metzger, B., Piha, M., Shurulinkov, P., Stach, R., Ström, K., Velmala, W. and Briedis, M. (2021), The Indo-European flyway: Opportunities and constraints reflected by Common Rosefinches breeding across Europe. J Biogeogr. 48:1255–1266. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14085&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14085&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the common rosefinch is still a rather exotic bird species. In the last decades the bird with its iconic song that is often rendered as “pleased to meet you” (&lt;a href=&#34;https://dibird.com/species/common-rosefinch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;check it out yourself&lt;/a&gt;), has expanded its huge breeding range westwards, and we have seen small populations emerging at new sites in Europe. During my undergraduate studies, my friend and co-author Roland Neumann was investigating a population at the Baltic Sea Coast. Since very little was known about their routes and their destinations, he was catching and banding individuals with the hope to get resightings from their wintering sites or from any location during their migratory journey. Unfortunately, the massive efforts didn’t pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were thus super excited that, in collaboration with the Swiss Ornithological Institute and co-funded by the German Ornithologists’ Society, we could deploy light-level geolocators on male rosefinches in 2011. These devices were still somewhat new in the sense that they have just gotten small enough to use on a 25g bird such as the common rosefinch. Those so called geolocators record light intensity that can be used after recapture and download of the data in the following year, to approximate their migratory journeys. At the same time, we were in close contact with colleagues from Czechia also working on this species and equally thrilled to deploy these loggers on some of the individuals from their Bohemian Mountain populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fieldwork went exceptionally and we had almost an entire year to make plans for the next field season in which we needed to especially look out for returning birds with geolocators, recapture them and retrieve the data containing so much information and the answer to our main questions of the birds’ whereabouts outside the breeding season. Both in northern Germany and in Czechia, we recaptured around 30% of the individuals (a reasonable return rate and the sample size we hoped for) just to learn that none of the devices recorded any data! Obviously, quite a downer that required some time to digest and to even think about rosefinch migration again. Yet, we decided to give it another go and repeat the study in 2013. This time we succeeded and collected useful data from several individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we learned that other research groups from across Europe were also collecting migration data from rosefinches. Colleagues from Finland deployed geolocators on males breeding as far north as Oulu (65°N), a Swedish research team collected tracks from males in southern Sweden, and besides the German and Czech data, Bulgarian colleagues were also successful in tracking rosefinches from their southern European breeding site (41°N). Since all of us were dealing with rather small sample sizes (3-10 tracks), we were all easily convinced and excited to pool the data allowing us to not only investigate population specific migration pattern in isolation but extend our objectives towards a flyway wide approach. Now, we saw the opportunity to identify general migration routes, bottlenecks as well as barriers on the so far understudied Indo-European flyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired, by previous large-scale research on the effects of wind on bird migration (Kranstauber et al. 2015 Ecology Letters) we constructed simple theoretical migration models that optimized the routes with respect to wind and resource availability during migration. These theoretical tracks revealed interesting patterns with seasonally specific bottlenecks such as the areas south of the Caspian Sea during spring migration. The comparison between the theoretical tracks and the collected empirical tracks also showed that rosefinches seem to make use of the straighter winds from India to Europe during spring, probably allowing for fast and direct migration to the breeding sites, while engaging in larger detours during autumn following the routes that provide highest security in terms of resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this study shows how valuable even small and local studies can be, if seen as puzzle pieces helping to reveal the larger picture. Obviously, this needs an open and collaborative network of researchers which I am very glad to have encountered during this project. I would like to thank all of my co-authors for sharing not only their data but for providing their insights into the study systems, for fruitful discussion, for pushing me hard to explain the modeling approach and forcing me to meet empirical fieldwork and theory halfway!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Light‐Level Geolocator Analyses: A user&#39;s guide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Established in 1987, the ARGOS system allowed the world-wide tracking of animals equipped with satellite transmitters. This new technology provided unprecedented insights into the movements of animals. But the devices were bulky as well as heavy and not yet ready to track the majority of smaller species like birds. In search for alternatives, the biologist Rory Wilson recalled that early voyagers did not have on-board GPS, nor satellite transmitters to ascertain their position (1). Instead, they observed the sun`s trajectory to estimate their whereabouts, using the day length to derive latitude and the exact time of noon to estimate longitude. He concluded that a simple light sensor, which requires far less power than a satellite transmitter, may provide reliable information about seabird movements across the annual cycle. After designing tags that consisted of a light sensor, a clock, a memory chip, and a lithium battery, he first deployed these tags on wandering albatrosses and Magellanic penguins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, geolocation by light has come a long way and is currently one of the most frequently used tracking technologies in bird migration research. A real boost in the number of applications happened after Bridget Stutchbury and her team deployed 1.5g geolocators developed by the British Antarctic Survey on different songbird species in 2008 (2). Recently, Migrate Technology Ltd. developed a 0.32g logger that successfully recorded a 13.000km migration route of 10g Willow warblers from Far East Russia to East Africa (3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./Fig1.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;Figure 1: One of the first light-level geolocators deployed on an animal, a Magellanic penguin, to track its movement. The tag was developed, built and deployed by Rory Wilson, despite huge amount of flack for this approach criticising that this method was only good for revealing movement on an ocean basin scale. One of the most recent developed tag weights only 0.35 g (from Migrate Technology Ltd.) and was used to track a 10 g Willow warbler (right).

&lt;p&gt;However, there was not only the need to build smaller and smaller tags, but to develop tools and methods that produce scientifically sound and reproducible tracks from light intensity recordings. The major downside of this technology is arguable the low accuracy compared to satellite mediated locations that results from the fact that light almost never hits the sensor of the logger without some level of shading. And even worse, the very same amount of shading has a very different effect on the accuracy depending on the time of the year and the actual location of the logger on the globe. Thus, researcher regularly struggled in the analysis and interpretation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011 the Swiss Ornithological Institute organised a first international workshop, at a beautiful site in the Alps, to discuss methods and potential developments of open source tools for the analysis of geolocator data. The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis funded another meeting in 2013 taking place in Santa Barbara, California. Stimulated or improved by these meetings, various R packages and other open source tools emerged that allow users to apply different theories and use additional information to improve the accuracy and precision of location estimates based on light recordings.
In our &amp;lsquo;HOW TO&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; paper that is part of the special issue on biologging in Journal of Animal Ecology (Lisovski et al. 2020) we now provide an overview of the different tools that may help in choosing an appropriate analysis method. Furthermore, we give advice on how to interpret and report results and introduce a comprehensive online manual that applies the concepts to several datasets, demonstrates the use of open‐source analysis tools with step‐by‐step instructions and code and details our recommendations for interpreting, reporting and archiving &lt;a href=&#34;https://geolocationmanual.vogelwarte.ch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though satellite tags are becoming smaller and smaller too, allowing to track small birds with high accuracy, we consider our efforts to be of value to the research community for the years to come. In addition to the relatively low costs, several recent technological advancements will perhaps even increase the appeal of light level geolocators. The most important among them is probably the combination of light recording with other en-route data, such as air pressure, acceleration, magnetism and temperature. These additional data can facilitate the refinement of location estimates. For instance, acceleration data or changes in air pressure can distinguish movement and residency periods relatively easily, and such prior knowledge can then be fed into the stationary location estimation. These additional sensor data also provide a wealth of complementary information on fine‐scale behaviour: air pressure and temperature can be used to infer flight altitude and initiation and termination of migratory or foraging flights; acceleration data can be used to determine daily activity budgets and, given supplementary measurements, be related to energy expenditure and energy budgets; magnetic field data can be used to infer strategies in orientation and navigation during migration. Combining such behavioural information with refined, reliable and accurate location estimates can assist in identifying habitat associations of migrants or their responses to evolutionarily novel factors such as artificial light at night, sensory pollution or wind farms. This knowledge will improve our understanding of the fates of migrants and the bottlenecks they might experience at sensitive times and places, which will allow us to improve our conservation and management strategies for migratory populations.&lt;/p&gt;
